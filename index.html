      <div class="blank"></div>
      <div class="section">This map shows land controlled by each party in The
        English Civil War. As you can see, by the end of the war, the
        Parliamentarians had control over most of the country. This meant that
        the Roundheads could easily take control of the whole country and
        eventually win the war. <br>
        <li>The main turning point in the war was the battle of Naesby in June
          1645, as the Parliamentarians won the battle and had acsess to more
          armour and weapons.</li>
        <li>At the beginning of the war the Royalists had more land and money,
          so did well to begin with, until the Roundheads came up with The New
          Model Army.</li>

    <div class="title" ,=""> The Battles </div>
    <div class="parallax1" ,="" style="background-image: url('images/war2.jpg');"><br>
      <div class="blank"></div>
      <div class="section">There were only four major battles in The English
        Civil war, even though it went on for around seven years.<br>
        The first battle was the Battle of Edge Hill in October 1642. As this
        battle was inconclusive in victory, all it really did was cost both
        parties soldiers and weapons.<br>
        The Battle of Adwalton Moor was a Royalist victory, so this meant, a)
        The Royalists gained money, land and confidence from this battle, b) The
        Parliamentarians had to really step there game up, as they had just lost
        troops, money and land to the Royalists and knew they were on the back
        foot now.<br>
        The Battle of Marston Moor would be a decisive victory for the
        Roundheads as they had developed their New Model Army and the Royalists
        weren't expecting it when they arrived ripe and ready for the battle.
        This meant it was an easy win for the Parliamentarians.<br>
        The Battle of Naseby was a real turning point in this war as over twice
        the amount of troops from the Cavaliers side compared to the Roundheads.
        This was expected however as the Parliamentarians had around double the
        troops for the battle, but King Charles decided to carry out the fight
        anyway. </div>

      <div class="blank"></div>
      <div class="section">The weapons of the English Civil war consisted but
        are not limited to these weapons below.<br>
        <div style="text-align: left;">The Pike: <img src="images/4668-src.jpg"
            alt="pike" title="Pike" style="width: 255px; height: 217px;"> This
          was a long pokey stick that was used to stop enemy charges with horses
          as shown in the background image.<br>
          The Musket: <img src="images/musket.jpg" alt="musket" title="Musket">
          This gun was used to fire from long distances at high speed and
          velocity.<br>
          The Mortar: <img src="images/mortar.jpg" alt="mortar" title="Mortar"
            style="width: 169px; height: 111px;"> This Artillery cannon like
          shooter fired large explosive balls high into the sky, which then
          rained back down to the ground and exploded enemy territory.<br>
          The cannon: <img src="images/cannon.jpg" alt="cannon" title="Cannon">
          This cannon's main use is to strike fear into the enemy as it was not
          very effective in battle <br>
